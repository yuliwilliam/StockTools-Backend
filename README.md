# StockTools
Compare daily holdings of an ETF, and write to a spreadsheet report. Quickly finished for personal use.  
May add more features to it later when have time.  
Directories are Windows format.  
Use as is.  
This is a proof of concept fork of the backend of the StockTools repo since the original repo is private.
